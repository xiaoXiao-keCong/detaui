# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
    # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]

    # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
    workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
    # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
    build:
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
        steps:
          - name: Checkout  #步骤1：checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1 #checkout需要引用的依赖
            with:
              repository: xiaoXiao-keCong/detaui
              path: detaui
          - name: install and build #步骤2：安装依赖和打包
            run: | #运行下面两行命令
              npm install -g yarn #安装yarn
              cd detaui # 确保在正确的目录中运行
              yarn install #安装依赖，当前分支的根目录做为默认目录
              yarn run build:web #打包代码
